# SDL-Sprites

This is me learning C++ by using the SDL2 libraries to create a game engine.
I know i could use Unity or unreal engine, but i feel "This is the way" to learn the nuts and bolts
of C++ and game code.
As i write it and encounter coding issues, i can allready see how to restructre it better, i will do that when i get a 
complete game.

Libraries used.
SDL2
SDL2-image
SDL2-mixer
